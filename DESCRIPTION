Description: In 2015, The 17 United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals were adopted. 'spiR' is a wrapper of several open datasets published by the Social Progress Imperative (<https://www.socialprogress.org/>), including the Social Progress Index (a synthetic measure of human development across the world). 'spiR''s goal is to provide data to help policymakers and researchers prioritize actions that accelerate social progress across the world in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals.
